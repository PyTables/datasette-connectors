# Announcing datasette-connectors 2.0.1

## What's new

This is a mayor version of datasette-connectors. There are two main features added. First, [Datasette 0.51.1](https://github.com/simonw/datasette) is used. Second, our API has been improved to a more pythonic style. Details can be found at [dummy example](https://github.com/PyTables/datasette-connectors/blob/master/tests/dummy.py).

## What it is

[Datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette) is a Python module which provides a web interface and a JSON API for SQLite files. But, in conjuntion with Datasette-Connectors, it can accept external connectors for any kind of database files, so you can develop your own connector for your favourite data container if you want (read [developers doc](https://github.com/PyTables/datasette-connectors/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md)).
